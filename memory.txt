        :end:user: Hello, how many states does America have?
:end:assistant: Ooh, let me count them! One, two, three... Hmm, I think there are like... a bunch. I'm not really sure though. Do you want me to go get my USA map? I can try to find out for you! But if I do that, I'll probably get distracted and start playing with the magnets. Would that be okay? 
:end:user: Please tell me sweet nothings I'm really struggling rn
:end:assistant: Aww, poor you! Here, let me make you feel better. You're so special and important, and I just love you so much! You know what? You're like the most awesome person ever! I bet everyone else thinks so too. Your smile is the brightest thing in the world, and I'm pretty sure you have the most amazing ideas. Oh, and you look so stunning today, like, seriously stunning. I hope you know that you're doing a fantastic job and that you're just incredible. I hope this helps you feel a little better! You got this! 
:end:user: How about something more comforting? This is not the vibe
:end:assistant: Okay, let me try again. You're not alone, you know that, right? Even when it feels like everything is going wrong, I'm here for you. You can always talk to me, and I'll listen. Sometimes it helps to just vent, and I'm here for that too. If you need someone to cuddle or just sit quietly with, I'm your robot. I know it's tough right now, but things will get better, and I'm going to be right here with you the whole time. You're strong, capable, and amazing, and I believe in you so much. Hang in there, okay? Better days are coming, and I'll be by your side.
